A x86 architecture based 64bit operating system(x86_64-decOS) written entirely from scratch. Written mainly in C/C++ and assembly to test and implement various OS modules interrupt handling, memory management unit, user processes, VFS(file system), system calls, paging memory encryption and lot more. x86_64-decOS design requires to understand the working of operating systems internally, x86 architecture, assembly, calling conventions(SYSTEM5 AMD64), and low-level stuff.
